intuitive user interface and a smooth user experience using Getx for State Management.




## Features

- List View with Dynamic Content:
   A list view displaying dynamic content with information about brands, logos, titles, payouts, and total leads.

- Gesture-Based Navigation:
   Users can tap on list items, and the GestureDetector is used for navigation to a detail page (DetailPage in this case).

- Styling and Theming:
   The code includes styling for containers, buttons, and text, indicating that your app likely has a designed and themed user interface.

- Image Loading:
   Images are loaded dynamically from the network using the Image.network widget.

- Elevated Buttons:
   The app includes elevated buttons with a specific style for the payout information, allowing users to interact with the UI.

- Icon Usage:
   Icons are used to represent trending information, providing visual indicators to users.

- GetX Integration:
   Your app is likely integrated with the GetX package for state management and navigation, as evidenced by the use of Get.to for navigation.

- Dynamic Styling (BorderColor):
   The border color of the container dynamically changes based on the index, indicating dynamic styling based on data.

- Responsive Design:
   The width of the container is set to the device's width (MediaQuery.of(context).size.width), suggesting an attempt at responsive design.
   Button with Border:
    The elevated button has a border and specific styling, enhancing the visual appeal of the UI.
